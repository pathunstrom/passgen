# passgen - Working Title

A tool I built to solve my problem. Complex password rules suck, and I wrote
this to have a generator to get around them when my traditional tools fail.
I wrote it to be "secure enough" for my use, and no more.

## Warning

I'm not saying this is the best password generator or even a good one, it is
specifically good enough for me. If you decide you like the idea and want to
use it, please understand you take the same risks I did when I wrote it.

## Install

Clone the repo locally, navigate to the directory, setup a virtual environment,
activate the environment, `pip install .`.

## Usage

With the environment active, `passgen` will run it with reasonable defaults.
Use the `-h` flag for what documentation is available.
